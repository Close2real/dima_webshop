                <p>Each employee is an important contributor to the University's mission and each employee is needed at work to assist in accomplishment of the universityâ€™s goals and objectives. Absenteeism and tardiness negatively impact services provided to students and the University community. Absenteeism also lowers the morale of other employees who have to perform the work of the absent employee.</p>

                <p>To ensure effective and efficient operations of the University and provide the best possible work environment to employees, the University expects employees to adhere to the attendance standards as outlined in this policy.</p>
